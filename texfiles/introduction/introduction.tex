\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}
%Here I will write my introduction. Needs a proper "m√•lbeskrivelse"!
Low clouds have a net warming effect in the Arctic~\citep{Intrieri2002a}, as opposed to the well known net cooling effect they have at lower latitudes. Low layered clouds (stratus) also dominate the Arctic cloud cover. The Arctic climate changes have been greater than the global mean and have become known by the term "Arctic amplification"~\citep{Graversen2008}. Therefore the climate effect of low clouds in the Arctic is an interesting topic to study.

Decreasing sea ice extent could lead to an increase in the aerosol number concentrations in the area where ice has retreated. The open sea surface it self would lead to an increase in release of sea salt and DMS (dimethyl sulfide) to the lower atmosphere. The lack of sea ice would also increase the likelihood that the sea could be used for shipping, which would pollute the area.

The enhancement of evaporation from diminishing sea ice and the increase in aerosol number concentration from open water and shipping could lead to denser and longer-lived low clouds in the area of sea ice retreat. A followup question to that is if these clouds would then have a slightly different radiative effect, and by that influence the further retreat of sea ice.


This warming is due the emission of longwave radiation that reaches the surface. At lower latitudes the clouds ability to reflect shortwave radiation would have a large enough cooling effect for the longwave emissions to be overpowered. In the Arctic the polar night in winter and high zenith angles in summer reduce the available shortwave radiation to reflect drastically, and the emission of longwave radiation outweighs the cooling effect by reflecting the shortwave radiation @(cite Intrieri, the right one)
 

%\textbf{Must rewrite: Aside from producing precipitation, clouds have a profound effect on our climate. If you consider the overall effect of all clouds on the surface temperature, they have a cooling effect because they block incoming solar radiation. However, the effect of an individual cloud depends on many factors such as its height, thickness, location, and whether it is day or night. .... tatt fra nettet, Colorado State, CMMAP}. Througout this thesis shortwave (SW) radiation means solar radiation and longwave (LW) radiation covers the terrestrial infrared radiation.

\section{Main goal}
According to the IPCC report by~\citet{Boucher2013} the study by~\citet{Eastman2010b} using visual cloud reports from the Arctic, with surface and satellite observations, and the studies by~\citet{Kay2009} and~\citet{Palm2010} using lidar and radar observations have confirmed that the low-cloud amount over the Arctic oceans varies inversely with sea ice amount. This means that there is an increase in cloud amount when there is less sea ice. Now what we want to know is if these clouds are also denser and more persistent, and could lead to an enhanced warming and reduced sea ice amount, a positive feedback.

With this thesis I try to find if a decrease in Arctic sea ice lead to denser and more persistent clouds. It has been suggested that the decline in sea ice extent would allow for more pollution in the Arctic, as a consequence of more open water and ship traffic. The effect of increase in aerosol concentrations from shipping and open water, and the effect of enhanced evaporation from open water are studied separately and combined. With the main goal to find if this would lead to changes in clouds that could enhance downwelling long wave radiation and decrease upwelling short wave radiation, both of which have warming effects.

\section{My contribution}%dette er rart sier Jon Egill!
The findings in my thesis have been achieved with some of the most recently developed code (by Greg Thompson~\citep{Thompson2014}) for cloud micro physics and aerosols and their effects on radiation, in modeling. The results build further on the work of other researchers @name-some-and-cite and may raise some questions for further research within the field.

\section{Area description}
The area of the study in this thesis is in the Arctic, north of the United States of America and north-west of Canada. The study area covers the Beaufort Sea and small parts of Alaska and Canada, and can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:area}.

There are a few reasons for choosing this as the study area. First it is in the Arctic, and sea ice is present there in autumn, even in 2012 when there was record low sea ice extent. Also it has been exposed to field campaigns: Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA)~\citep{Uttal2002}, First International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project Regional Experiment Arctic cloud Experiment (FIRE ACE)~\citep{Curry2000}, Mixed-Phase Arctic Cloud Experiment (M-PACE)~\citep{Verlinde2007} and more. Therefore there are many studies on Arctic clouds that include this study area and data from some of the mentioned field campaigns. This provides parts of the science basis for my study and selection of literature and studies for comparison and questions. Quite a few studies are based on satellite data analysis and some of them are presented in the next chapter as background and motivation for my thesis.

\section{Background}%Background and motivation?
\label{sec:background}
In this chapter I shall present some recent literature on the subject, that forms a basis for the study presented in this thesis.

%Some new (and older) research that makes my thesis interesting and relevant to the field. No one has done this study with a weather forecasting model, it is interesting to look at changes in parameters in similar meteorological conditions, the same initial and boundary conditions in every run.
%Describe some of the work done by %\citet{Palm2010, Wu2012} and others on autumn low clouds in the Arctic to emphasize the importance of my work.

A study by~\citet{Schweiger2008} investigated the connection between sea ice variability and cloud cover over over the Arctic seas during autumn. They analysed the ERA-40 re-analysis products and some satellite data sets. %the Television and Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) Polar Pathfonder datasets~\citep{Schweiger2008}.
They found that that sea ice retreat was linked to a decrease in low-level (surface to $\sim$1.9~km) cloud amount and an increase in mid-level ($\sim$1.9 to 6.1~km) clouds. They state that the decrease in static stability and deepening of the atmospheric boundary layer, following ice retreat, contribute to the rise in cloud level.

The study by~\citet{Vavrus2010} investigated the behaviour of clouds, during intervals of rapid sea ice loss in the Arctic in the 21st century. The study was done by use of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM3). Their results support that cloud changes appear to accelerate rapid loss of sea ice in autumn, and possibly in winter. They also conclude that "the trends in total cloudiness during rapid ice loss events are explained almost entirely by low-level clouds" and that "a positive feedback from primarily low cloud changes amid a warming climate".

\citet{Kay2009} combined satellite data and complementary data sets to study the Arctic cloud and atmospheric structure during summer and early Autumn over the years 2006-2008. This covers the at the time record low sea ice extent from 2007. In contrast to the study by~\citet{Schweiger2008} they found more low-level cloud. There are reasons to believe that the observations used in their study are more accurate than the re-analysis used in~\citet{Schweiger2008}.


\citet{Eastman2010a} analysed visual cloud reports from the Arctic for year-to-year variations and found that following a low-ice September there would be enhanced low cloud cover.

The study by~\citet{Palm2010} using satellite and lidar data and found that areas of open water were associated with greater polar cloud fraction. %from the Ice Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO)  found that areas of open water were associated with greater polar cloud fraction.


A common uncertainty and missing link in a few of these studies is that they did not look at liquid water content, effective radii and other parameters affecting the radiative properties of the clouds. In this study, that is what I want to look in to, how these properties are influenced by the changing sea ice, and if the clouds enhance the sea ice melt.


%Is my work new thinking and does it seem to be very extensive?

%Should this whole chapter be a part of introduction..?

%Previous studies, shed light on why my study is interesting and may be of importance.

\section{Structure of the thesis}
%In the following chapter~\ref{chap:background} I will present the background for my thesis; what work I hope to compare my results to and relate my thesis to. Also I will touch upon why the subject of my thesis is important. 
In the following chapter, Chapter~\ref{chap:theory}, the most important theory needed to understand some of the processes in clouds and their possible effect on the sea ice is presented. Chapter~\ref{chap:modmet} is where I explain which model and tools and I have used and how I have worked with them to get the results presented and discussed in chapter~\ref{chap:results}. A summary of main findings and conclusions are presented in the last chapter~\ref{chap:summaryconclusions}, before the list of references at the very end.
