\section{Radiation and clouds}
How clouds scatter and absorb SW and LW radiation.
Explain something about blackbodies, clouds and blackbodies? Stefan–Boltzmanns law states that the flux density emitted by a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature @citeLiou2002page12. For a greybody, like a cloud, the equation can be written
\begin{equation}
F = \epsilon \sigma T^4
\end{equation}
where the emissivity of the greybody, $\epsilon(units?)$, is included. $F(units)$ is the flux density emitted by the greybody, $\sigma = 5.67\cdot 10^{-8} Jm^{-2}sec^{-1}deg^{-4}$ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant.


Write about optical depth from Wallace and Hobbs.

Low clouds have bases below 2000 m. Stratus (St) are layered clouds that form when extensive areas of stable air are lifted. Stratus clouds are normally between 0.5 and 1~km thick, whereas they can be several km wide. (@citeAguadoBurtpage188?)
