\chapter{Clouds and Radiation}%("Theory of ...."?)
\label{chap:theory}
In this chapter, a brief overview of clouds in the Arctic is presented first. In general clouds consist of droplets that absorb and scatter shortwave (SW) radiation and absorb and emit longwave (LW) radiation. Throughout this thesis, solar radiation is referred to as SW radiation, whereas the LW radiation covers the terrestrial infrared radiation, emitted by the Earth and clouds. How clouds affect both the SW and LW radiation reaching the surface is important knowledge when studying the potential climatic effects of clouds. There are several cloud properties that affect how the cloud affects the radiation from the sun and the Earth. These will be described in the second part of this chapter. Last in this chapter a small section on aerosols is included. Aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN), where water vapor condensates or freezes on the aerorol and becomes a cloud droplet or ice particle.

\section{Arctic clouds}
%\section{Clouds} \subsection{The basics} \subsection{The Arctic}
The Arctic cloud cover is dominated by low clouds, and most high amounts of stratus clouds are over the oceans~\citep{Klein1993}. The Arctic is the only region where the season of maximum stratus does not correspond to the season of greatest lower troposphere static stability~\citep{Klein1993}, which could be due to lack of evaporation during the cold winter months. According to~\citet{Klein1993} stratus in the Arctic basin peaks during summer at nearly 62\%, while during the winter season the stratus only accounts for 18\% of the cloud cover. This leads them to conclude that the seasonal cycle of stratus in the Arctic is driven by the temperature cycle, thereby moisture content in the atmosphere, rather than the static stability.%(, as opposed to other areas.)
%Are there any typical cloud properties special to the arctic? CURRY!

The air in the Arctic is very stable in winter (polar night), and clean since there are not many sources for pollution. In Autumn the sea ice extent reaches a minimum after the summer melting and leaves open water to influence low clouds and their properties. 

Low clouds have bases below 2000~m. Stratus (St) are layered clouds that form when extensive areas of stable air are lifted. Stratus clouds are normally between 0.5 and 1~km thick, whereas they can be several km wide~\citep{Aguado2010}.

\section{Cloud effects on radiation}
\subsection{Liquid Water Content and Path}
The cloud microphysical properties that determine the cloud radiative properties include: the amount of condensed water, the size and shape of the cloud particles, and the phase of the particles/and if the particles are liquid or ice~\citep{Curry1996}. The amount of condensed water can be expressed by the liquid water content (LWC) in the cloud, often presented with units g~m$^{-3}$, and is proportional to the cloud droplet number consentrations when we use the median volume radius, $\overline{r}$, $\mu~m$. From~\citet{Rogers1989} we can express the number of droplets with radius $r$ by
\begin{equation}
N = \int n(r) dr
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the cloud droplet number concentration cm$^{-3}$, and $n(r)$ is the number of droplets with radius $r$.
The LWC can be written
\begin{eqnarray}
LWC &=& \int \rho_L \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 n(r) dr\\
&=& \frac{4}{3} \pi \rho_L \int r^3 n(r) dr\\
&=& \frac{4}{3} \pi \rho_L \overline{r}^3 \int n(r) dr\\
&=& \frac{4}{3} \pi \rho_L \overline{r}^3 N 
\end{eqnarray}
where the last equation shows the proportionality of LWC to the cloud droplet number concentration $N$, and $\rho_L$ is the density of liquid water.

If the LWC is integrated over the height of the cloud, from the cloud base to the cloud top, we find the liquid water path (LWP) of that cloud.
\begin{equation}
LWP = \int_{base}^{top} LWC \cdot dz
\end{equation}
The LWP is the column of liquid water in a cloud and is usually expressed by $g~m^{-2}$.

\subsection{Cloud droplet effective radius}
The cloud droplet effective radius determines several important radiative properties of a cloud and is therefore of particular interest. For example it determines the cloud albedo~\citep{Hansen1974}, which I will go more into when describing the first indirect effect later in this chapter.

The cloud droplet effective radius is a weighted mean of the size distribution of cloud droplets. The effective radius may be written
\begin{equation}
r_e = \frac{\int r^3 n(r) dr}{\int r^2 n(r) dr}
\end{equation}
where $r_e$ is the effective radius.

\subsection{The Cloud -- a gray body}
Stefan–Boltzmanns law states that the flux density emitted by a black body is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature~\citep{Liou2002}. For a gray body, like a cloud, the equation can be written
\begin{equation}
F = \epsilon \sigma T^4
\end{equation}
where the emissivity of the greybody, $\epsilon$, is included. $F [W~m^{-2}]$ is the flux density emitted by the gray body, and $\sigma = 5.67\cdot 10^{-8} Jm^{-2}sec^{-1}deg^{-4}$ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant.

\subsection{Optical depth}
Normal optical depth or optical thickness, $\tau_{\lambda}$ is a measure of the cumulative depletion that a beam of radiation directed straight downward (zenith angle $\theta = 0$) would experience in passing through a defined layer \citep{Wallace2006}. The optical depth can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\tau_{\lambda} = \int_z^{\infty} k_{\lambda} \rho R dz
\end{equation}
where $k_{\lambda}$ is the mass absorption coefficient, which has units of $m^2~kg^{-1}$, $\rho$ is the density of air, which has units of $kg~m^{-3}$, and $R$ is the mass of the absorbing gas per unit mass of air.

As mentioned in Chapter~\ref{chap:introduction} Introduction there is no solar radiation to reflect during winter and the polar night in the Arctic, whereas in the summer the zenith angle is so high that even though there is sunlight 24 hours a day the cooling effect in summer does not average out the heating effect the clouds have in winter. A high zenith angle, means that the radiation has to travel to more atmosphere, which gives a higher optical depth and stronger depletion of the radiation beam. Consequently, the low clouds' ability to absorb and emit terrestrial radiation dominates over their reflective effect on the solar radiation.

%How do clouds reflect radiation? What is the effect of more water? Or more ice? What about the droplet size? (effective radius)\\
%How do clouds absorb and emit radiation? Effect of more or less water or ice? Droplet size?

I%ce is more effective in reflecting SW than water. Snow has a higher albedo than rain. Is there any use in presenting some albedo values for water, snow, ice? Or open water versus sea ice? New ice versus old sea ice?

%Make sure to include something on how LWC/LWP and effective radii plays in, if this is to be mentioned in the results or discussion!!

\section{Aerosols and clouds}%Aerosols and clouds som tittel??
Aerosols have a direct effect on the climate by scattering and absorbing SW radiation, and scattering, absorbing and emitting LW radiation.% acting as CCNs og INs. elaborate?
They also have numerous effects on clouds by for example acting as CCNs and INs. The amount of CCNs and INs available affect the properties of the clouds in the area.
If there are few CCNs in an area, a cloud formed there would be a clean cloud with few, but large droplets and therefore have a low albedo and precipitate easily. If the area had high aerosol concentration, the cloud would be polluted and have more numerous but smaller droplet, which means it would have a higher albedo and precipitation would be suppressed. 

Not only the aerosol burden is important, if it is the same for two areas with different meteorological forcing that would also affect the cloud properties. Say an area has a weaker updraft than another area, a cloud formed due to the weaker updraft will have lower LWC, lower albedo and little precipitation. The cloud formed in a stronger updraft will have higher LWC, higher albedo and be more precipitating.

@introduction?---
Diminishing sea ice could lead to an increase in the aerosol number concentrations in the area where ice has retreated. The open sea surface it self would lead to an increase in release of sea salt and DMS to the lower atmosphere @cite. The lack of sea ice would also increase the likelyhood that the sea could be used for shipping, which would pollute the area @cite.

There are two known indirect effects that aerosols have on radiation, through clouds. The first indirect effect was proposed by~\citet{Twomey1974} and is often referred to as the Twomey effect. The second indirect effect was proposed by~\citet{Albrecht1989} and is also known as the lifetime effect.

\subsection{The first indirect effect}% (Maybe just call it all indirect effects and refer to Lohmann and Feichter)
The first indirect effect, suggested by~\citet{Twomey1974}, describes the enhancement of cloud albedo as a consequence of an increase in aerosol content and thereby available CCNs.
In short, the first indirect effect is a cloud albedo enhancement.
By increasing droplet concentration and hence the optical thickness of a cloud, pollution acts to increase the reflectance of clouds~\citep{Twomey1977}. 
The optical thickness is increased when the number of CCN is increased. Although the changes are small, the long term effects on climate can be profound~\citep{Twomey1974}.

The optical depth will change with changes in aerosol number concentrations and changes in clouds and their properties. For instance if a cloud has many small droplets, the optical depth will be higher. Whereas  fewer cloud droplets will yield a lower optical depth, resulting in more SW radiation reaching the ground — possibly having a warming effect on the area. 

Include a figure showing the indirect effect? :)

\subsection{The second indirect effect}
The second indirect effect, or the cloud lifetime effect, suggests more numerous but smaller droplets reduce the precipitation efficiency and by that enhances the cloud lifetime and hence the cloud reflectivity~\citep{Albrecht1989}. This effect has been estimated to be roughly as large as the first indirect effect~\citep{Lohmann2005}.

\subsection{Cloud effects on aerosols/The presence of aerosols}
Cloud presence is due to water vapor condensating on CCNs and possibliy freezing if the aerosol's structure resembles that of an ice crystal, IN. Processes known to affect the local aerosol concentration are: precipitation because the precipitation will bring with it the CCNs and INs that available water vapor has nucleated on (either condensed or frozen), this is also known as scavenging (removal of aerosols by precipitation). Pollution in the area increases the local aerosol concentration. Increases in aerosol concentration might inhibit precipitation and cause longer-lived, more persistent clouds, which will in turn affect the radiation balance.
