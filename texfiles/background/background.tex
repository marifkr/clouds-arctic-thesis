\chapter{Background}
\label{chap:background}
In this chapter I shall present some recent literature on the subject. Some new (and older) research that makes my thesis interesting and relevant to the field. No one has done this study with a weather forecasting model, it is interesting to look at changes in parameters in similar meteorological conditions, the same initial and boundary conditions in every run.
Describe some of the work done by Palm2010? WuLee2012 and others on autumn low clouds in the Arctic to emphasize the importance of my work.

Is my work new thinking and does it seem to be very extensive?
