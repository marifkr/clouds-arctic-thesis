\chapter{Background}%Background and motivation?
\label{chap:background}
In this chapter I shall present some recent literature on the subject. Some new (and older) research that makes my thesis interesting and relevant to the field. No one has done this study with a weather forecasting model, it is interesting to look at changes in parameters in similar meteorological conditions, the same initial and boundary conditions in every run.
Describe some of the work done by \citet{Palm2010, Wu2012} and others on autumn low clouds in the Arctic to emphasize the importance of my work.

Is my work new thinking and does it seem to be very extensive?

Should this whole chapter be a part of introduction..?


Previous studies, shed light on why my study is interesting and may be of importance.
