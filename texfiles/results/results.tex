\chapter{Results and discussion}
\label{chap:results}
In this chapter I will present the findings made in this study.  The daily averaged differences have been calculated by subtracting the field from the control run for one time from the same field at the same time from a different run, these differences have then been added together and divided by the number of differences that were added together.(@insert equation for clarity?)

\section{Reference figures from the control run}
First we want to have something to compare with and to look back to when studying the differences from the control run to the runs with changed sea ice and/or aerosol concentration. I shall include figures for diurnal mean of LWP, $r_e$ of cloud droplet, cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), both LW and SW up at the TOA and down at the surface. Also the IWP, cloud ice number concentration (CINC), and $r_e$ of snow and ice may be of interest. In addition, the state of the weather situation should be considered when interpreting the results. Therefore maps with wind barbs for the wind at 10~m height and temperature at 2~m are included in this section.

\section{Consequences of removal of sea ice, without manually changing the aerosol concentration}
Lets start with average difference in LWP for NoIce - Control, day 2 (day 1 has been left out of this discussion to avoid the spin-up time. (I want to look more closely into day 1 as well, which is when the atmosphere is still almost the same as it was for the control run.)
 There is a slight difference in LWP for the whole field (2.04$gm^{-2}$), but the area of interest in this case is where the sea ice is no longer present. There the increase in LWP is significantly higher, >25$gm^{-2}$ for the most northern part. This implies that there is a new cloud forming in that area, that could not form when there was sea ice. The removal of the sea ice has allowed for increased evaporation and an increase in latent heat flux as can be seen from figure(@LH NoIce), where the area that sea ice was removed from is obvious. The northern-most part of the study area also has an increase in the cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) with about the same shape and size as the LWP. The avergae increase in the CDNC would be approximately 5 droplets per cubic centimeter (@show conversion from $10^6/kg$ to $per cc$), but since this is the average over 11 layers, the cloud could be in just a few of those layers, and have a CDNC of approximately 25 $cm^{-3}$ if it stretches over two layers for example. The increase in effective radius in the same area could also be due to a lack of cloud there in the control run, whereas now that it has formed, the droplets actually have a radius.The small "blob" at 140$^o$W and about 81$^o$N has decreased effective radius, most likely because the cloud already was saturated in that area, which can be seen from the LWP from the control run, in figure~\ref{fig:LWPr1Day2}. The possible increase in aerosols from the ocean that would then lead to an increase in CCNs would make the water in that cloud spread over more CCNs, and by that leave the droplets with a smaller $r_e$.

\label{fig:LWPr1Day2}
\end{figure}

The kind of U-shape that we can see in the figure for difference in effective radius is also clear in the difference in downward radiation at the ground surface, for both SW and LW. The SW radiation flux at ground surface has been reduced, which is due to the increase in LWP. This can be explained by equations(@refer to eqn for LWP and optical depth and albedo??), where it is clear that an increase in the LWP for a column would increase the cloud optical depth, and thereby also the albedo of that column. The downward LW radiation flux at the surface has been increased due to the increase in LWP, which means that there is more water in the clouds and they emit more LW to the ground. The LW at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) does not experience such an increase, in fact it experiences a slight decrease. That it doesn't experience the same increase is explained by the equation for cloud LW emissivity(@refer, but find it first!), which is dependent of temperature. We see from the vertical cross section showing temperature contours (@refer and make), that the temperature is higher in lower clouds, than in the higher %should i rather refer to the temperature difference between the surfaca and low clouds? rather than low clouds and high clouds?
–- therefore the low clouds have higher emittance of LW. The removal of sea ice has a larger effect on lower clouds than on higher clouds, since the increase in evaporation from the surface doesn't reach high up in the troposphere, especially not in the Arctic, due to the static stability of the lower atmosphere in the Arctic(@cite someone?). Also the LWP showed in this study is only for the lowermost 11 layers and can only explain what happens in those layers, it can not be used as a final explanation for radiation changes that are only at the bottom and top of the modeled atmosphere.

%Include figure with vertical temperature changes? or just show vertical temperature for all runs in one plot with subplots?
Of course, the removal of sea ice would reduce the reflected SW radiation flux at the TOA. The albedo of sea ice varies between (@input values), depending on the age of the ice and is typically (@insert value), where as the albedo of the ocean often is taken as (@insert value). Thus the change in SW at TOA is mainly negative over the area of ocean where there was sea ice in the control run. The two blobs of increased SW at TOA can be recognized as the tips of the pillars in the U-shape I referred to earlier in figure(@which one?the effective radius?) which also represent an increase in LWP and reduction in SW at surface and increase of LW at surface, this is therefore most likely due to the enhanced albedo caused by new clouds at those locations. Since these figures don't show in-cloud changes, simply the difference between two fields.

The heat fluxes are almost unchanged for most of the study area by the removal of sea ice, except for the area where the sea ice has been removed. Especially for the northernmost part of the study area and "sea ice removed area" the fluxes are a lot higher than in the control run. This is not surprising, since one would expect the ocean surface to hold a higher temperature than the sea ice. Also a lot more heat would be released due to evaporation than in the case when sea ice is present.

\section{What about if we left the sea ice unchanged, but increased the aerosol number concentration by a factor of 10 for the whole period?}
The increase in available CCNs leads to obvious increases in CDNC and LWP, and the expected reduction in $r_e$. If we look back to equation(@the one that combines LWP, effective radius and cloud optical depth). As for the NoIce run, the increase in LWP, in this case a lot higher, leads to an increase in clouds and their reflectance (albedo), therefore the SW at TOA is higher, here the signal is not disrupted by any changes made to the sea ice, so the increase is obvious. Thus the SW at the surface is significantly lower than in the control run. This represents a cooling of (@calculate the flux changes into temperature changes?). The average LW radiation flux at the surface is higher due to the increase in LWP and emittance by the thicker and denser(is this true) clouds.

The effect on the heat fluxes by increasing the aerosol number concentration is not clear, and probably insignificant.

\section{Day 5, with no ice, and unchanged aerosols}
Why the crap does the effective radius, LWP and CDNC go down significantly and simultaneously for the removal of sea ice at day 5?? What is up with this system? Could it be rain? From the figure I made it doesn't look like it is due to rain, 'cause it actually looks like rain is also reduced in this case, which is STRANGE!... what??? And the heat flux differences also look crazy, very clear increase right next to an equally clear decrease, the switch happens at the sea ice edge. That makes sense :) but the rest doesn't!!
Jon Egill suggested that I check ice and snow too, see if that can explain the difference!


\section{Day 5, sea ice unchanged and aerosol concentration multiplied by 10}
Also, why can we see the sea ice edge in the areo10-control?? The sea ice has not been changed for this run! I suggest that this is due to the decrease in SW reaching the surface, and therefore the small part of the downwelling SW radiation that is absorbed when it reaches the sea ice is smaller than when the SW is higher. Therefore the SH and LH is lower where there is ice. The change here is small, and not of the same order as when the sea ice is removed. (check the sea ice anyway, is there a difference between sea ice in control and sea ice in aero 10?

--------------

The longwave cloud emissitvity is sensitiv to an increase in water amount as long as the LWP is less than $\approx$ 40-45 g/m$^2$. It is clear in Day 5 from the control run that the LWP was around 60-100 g/m$^2$ in the middle lower area of the figure@ (around these lat and lon?@). This is also seen in that there is no significant change in LW downward at the surface or upward at the TOA (see figures@). The area with lack of change in LW up or down is approximately the same area as where there is a negative change in LH and SH upward from the surface over the sea ice. Since there has been no change in LW there is no loss of warming from a decrease in LW reaching the surface, but the change can be explained by looking at the SW radiation(@figures). The downward SW at the surface has been significantly decreased as a consequence of the increase in aerosols. The SW radiation has been reflected by the smaller and more numerous droplets(@figures). This is known as the Twomey effect, and was described in Chapter~\ref{chap:theory}. The albedo of sea ice is typically (@numbers) which means that a small fraction of the incident SW radiation is absorbed. Since the amount of incident SW radiation at the surface has been reduced by the cloud cover, the absorbed radiation is less than for a higher incident amount. The ice therefore has a lower temperature to give off SH with. 

Look at temperature changes at the surface. Over ice and ocean.. The SSTs are the same for all the runs and there is no coupling with the ocean. The skin temperature for the domain shows a small decrease in the same area as where there is less sensible and latent heat release.

Also the dynamics over ice and the ocean are different, so this could have an effect. The cold air over the ice may be intensified, while the warmer air over the ocean would not change due to SST-changes, so the response may be smaller there...?
