\chapter{Results and discussion}
\label{chap:results}
In this chapter I will present the findings made in this study.  The daily averaged differences have been calculated by subtracting the field from the control run for one time from the same field at the same time from a different run, these differences have then been added together and divided by the number of differences that were added together.(@insert equation for clarity?)

\section{Reference figures from the control run}
First we want to have something to compare with and to look back to when studying the differences from the control run to the runs with changed sea ice and/or aerosol concentration. I shall include figures for diurnally averaged fields of LWP, $r_e$ of cloud droplet, cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), both LW and SW up at the TOA and down at the surface. Also the IWP, cloud ice number concentration (CINC), and $r_e$ of snow and ice may be of interest. In addition, the state of the weather situation should be considered when interpreting the results. Therefore maps with wind barbs for the wind at 10~m height and temperature at 2~m are included in this section. \textit{(De ligger i slutten av kapittelet forelopig, slik at de ikke er i veien for leseren utover i teksten.)}

\section{Removed sea ice}
%-----------------------
\subsection{Day 2}
Lets start with average difference in LWP for NoIce - Control, day 2 (see figure~\ref{fig:relwpcdnc_r2Day2}). \textit{(day 1 has been left out of this discussion to avoid the spin-up time. I want to look more closely into day 1 as well, which is when the atmosphere is still almost the same as it was for the control run, will be included in next draft.)} There is a slight difference in LWP for the whole field (2.04$gm^{-2}$, see figure~\ref{fig:relwpcdnc_r2Day2}), but the area of interest in this case is where the sea ice is no longer present. There the increase in LWP is significantly higher, >25$gm^{-2}$ for the most northern part (which is in the bottom right corner). This implies that there is a new cloud forming in that area, that could not form when there was sea ice. The removal of the sea ice has allowed for increased evaporation and an increase in latent heat (LH) flux which can be seen from figure~\ref{fig:lhdiff_r2Day2}, where the area that sea ice was removed from is obvious. The northernmost part of the study area also has an increase in the cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), figure~\ref{fig:relwpcdnc_r2Day2}, with about the same shape and size as the LWP, which fits well with equation~\ref{eqn:lwc_prop_cdnc}, which we know from the theory presented in chapter~\ref{chap:theory}. 

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:lwc_prop_cdnc}
LWC = \frac{4}{3}\pi \rho r_e^3 N
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{The averaged difference in $r_e$ of cloud droplets, LWP and CDNC (from left to right) for the run with no ice, over the lowermost 11 layers for day 2. (preliminary figure)}
\label{fig:relwpcdnc_r2Day2}
\end{figure}

The amount of liquid water is proportional to the number concentration, and the LWP is the integral over the LWC, where we recall that N is the CDNC. The average increase in the CDNC would be approximately 5 droplets per cubic centimeter. The figure shows the numbers with units $10^6/kg$, which can be approximated to the more common units for CDNC, per cubic centimeter ($cm^{-3}$). If we assume that we are close enough to the surface to assume a pressure $p=1000hPa$, and thereby the density to be $\rho_a = 1kg/m^3=1kg/10^6cm^3$, then we could write $CDNC : 10^6/kg = cm^{-3}$. Since this is the average over 11 layers, to a height of about 1600~m, the cloud could be in just a few of those layers, and have a CDNC of approximately 25 $cm^{-3}$ if it stretches over two layers for example. The increase in effective radius in the same area also indicates the formation of a new cloud,figure~\ref{fig:relwpcdnc_r2Day2}, that could not form in the control run (see figure~\ref{fig:recloud_r1Day2}), whereas now that it has formed, the droplets actually have a radius. The small "blob" at 140$^o$W and about 81$^o$N has decreased $r_e$, most likely because the cloud already was saturated in that area, which can be seen from the LWP from the control run, in figure~\ref{fig:LWPr1Day2}. The possible increase in aerosols from the ocean that would then lead to an increase in CCNs would make the water in that cloud spread over more CCNs, and by that leave the droplets with a smaller $r_e$.

\label{fig:lhdiff_r2Day2}
\end{figure}


The kind of U-shape that we can see in the figure for difference in $r_e$, figure~\ref{fig:relwpcdnc_r2Day2}, is also clear in the difference in downward radiation at the ground surface, for both SW and LW. The SW radiation flux at ground surface has been reduced, which is due to the increase in LWP. This can be explained by equations~\ref{eqn:cloudalbedo} and~\ref{eqn:cloudtau_sw}, where it is clear from equation~\ref{eqn:cloudtau_sw} that the cloud optical depth, $\tau_{sw}$, increases with LWP, and from equation~\ref{eqn:cloudalbedo} it is clear that an increase in $\tau_{sw}$ would also increase the cloud albedo.

The downward LW radiation flux at the surface has been increased due to the increase in LWP, which means that there is more water in the clouds and they emit more LW to the ground. It was shown in Chapter~\ref{chap:theory} that an increase in LWP increases the cloud optical depth also in the LW, see equation~\ref{eqn:cloudtau_lw}, which in turn increases the emissivity of the cloud, shown in equation~\ref{eqn:epsilon_lw}. The LW at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) does not experience such an increase, in fact it experiences a slight decrease. That it doesn't experience the same increase is explained by the Stefan-Boltzmann's law presented in chapter~\ref{chap:theory}, where the flux density emitted by a body, in this case a cloud, is dependent on the temperature. % equation for cloud LW emissivity(@refer, but find it first!), which is dependent of temperature.
\textit{ We see from the vertical cross section showing temperature contours (@refer and make), that the temperature is higher at the surface than in the clouds, therefore the clouds have a lower emittance of LW. (this figure will come in the next draft, but is currently not averaged)}
%The removal of sea ice has a larger effect on lower clouds than on higher clouds, since the increase in evaporation from the surface doesn't reach high up in the troposphere, especially not in the Arctic, due to the static stability of the lower atmosphere in the Arctic(@cite someone?). Also the LWP showed in this study is only for the lowermost 11 layers and can only explain what happens in those layers, it can not be used as a final explanation for radiation changes that are only at the bottom and top of the modeled atmosphere.

\label{fig:swupdiff_r2Day2}
\end{figure}
%Include figure with vertical temperature changes? or just show vertical temperature for all runs in one plot with subplots?
Of course, the removal of sea ice would reduce the reflected SW radiation flux at the TOA, see figure~\ref{fig:swupdiff_r2Day2}. The albedo of sea ice varies between 0.5 and 0.9 depending on snow cover and the age of the ice and is typically 0.5-0.7 for bare ice, whereas a typical ocean albedo is 0.06. Thus the change in SW at TOA is mainly negative over the area of ocean where there was sea ice in the control run. The two blobs of increased SW at TOA, see figure~\ref{fig:swupdiff_r2Day2}, can be recognized as the tips of the pillars in the U-shape I referred to for $r_e$ earlier (in figure~\ref{fig:relwpcdnc_r2Day2}) which also represent an increase in LWP and reduction in SW at surface and increase of LW at surface. This is therefore most likely due to the enhanced albedo caused by new clouds at those locations, since these figures don't show in-cloud changes, simply the difference between two fields.

\caption{The average difference in SH flux up from the surface at day 2 .}
\label{fig:shdiff_r2Day2}
\end{figure}

The heat fluxes are almost unchanged for most of the study area by the removal of sea ice, except for the area where the sea ice has been removed (see figures~\ref{fig:lhdiff_r2Day2} and~\ref{fig:shdiff_r2Day2}). Especially for the northernmost part of the study area and "sea ice removed area" the fluxes are a lot higher than in the control run. This is not surprising, since one would expect the ocean surface to hold a higher temperature than the sea ice. Also a lot more heat would be released due to evaporation than in the case when sea ice is present.

\subsection{Day 5}
I still can't explain what is going on i figure~\ref{fig:relwpcdnc_r2Day5}. I have tried to look into differences in rain, and snow, and graupel and ice content, but I can't seem to figure it out...
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{results/cdnclwpre_r2Day5.png}
\caption{The average differences in $r_e$, LWP and CDNC from left to right, for day 5. (preliminary figure)}
\label{fig:relwpcdnc_r2Day5}
\end{figure}
%Why the crap does the effective radius, LWP and CDNC go down significantly and simultaneously for the removal of sea ice at day 5?? What is up with this system? Could it be rain? From the figure I made it doesn't look like it is due to rain, 'cause it actually looks like rain is also reduced in this case, which is STRANGE!... what??? And the heat flux differences also look crazy, very clear increase right next to an equally clear decrease, the switch happens at the sea ice edge. That makes sense :) but the rest doesn't!!
%Jon Egill suggested that I check ice and snow too, see if that can explain the difference!

%-------------------------------------
\section{Increased aerosol concentration}
%-------------------------------------
\subsection{Day2}
The increase in available CCNs leads to obvious increases in CDNC and LWP, and the expected reduction in $r_e$, see figure~\ref{fig:cdnclwpre_Aero10}.% If we look back to equation~\ref{eqn:cloudtau}, we see that (@the one that combines LWP, effective radius and cloud optical depth).
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{results/diff_cdnclwpre_Aero10_Day2.png}
\caption{The average differences in $r_e$, LWP and CDNC from left to right, for day 2. (preliminary figure)}
\label{fig:cdnclwpre_Aero10}
\end{figure}

 As for the NoIce run, the increase in LWP, in this case a lot higher, leads to an increase in clouds and their reflectance (albedo), therefore the SW at TOA is higher, here the signal is not disrupted by any changes made to the sea ice, so the increase is obvious, and is shown in figure~\ref{fig:swup_down_r3Day2}. Thus the SW at the surface is significantly lower than in the control run. This represents a cooling of (@calculate the flux changes into temperature changes?). The average LW radiation flux at the surface is higher due to the increase in LWP and thereby increased emittance by the clouds.% thicker and denser(is this true) clouds.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{results/diff_swupdown_Aero10_Day2.png}
\caption{The average difference in SW down at the surface, and up at TOA, from left to right, for day 2. (preliminary figure)}
\label{fig:swup_down_r3Day2}
\end{figure}
The effect on the heat fluxes by increasing the aerosol number concentration is not clear, and probably insignificant (not shown).

\subsection{Day 5}
%Also, why can we see the sea ice edge in the areo10-control?? The sea ice has not been changed for this run! I suggest that this is due to the decrease in SW reaching the surface, and therefore the small part of the downwelling SW radiation that is absorbed when it reaches the sea ice is smaller than when the SW is higher. Therefore the SH and LH is lower where there is ice. The change here is small, and not of the same order as when the sea ice is removed. (check the sea ice anyway, is there a difference between sea ice in control and sea ice in aero 10?
%--------------
The LW cloud emissivity is sensitive to an increase in water amount as long as the LWP is less than $\approx$ 40-45 g/m$^2$. It is clear in day 5 from the control run that the LWP was around 60-100 g/m$^2$ in the middle lower area of figure~\ref{fig:LWPr1Day5}.%@ (around these lat and lon?@).
This is also seen in that there is no significant change in LW downward at the surface or upward at the TOA, see figure~\ref{fig:lwup_down_r3Day5}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{results/diff_lwupdown_Aero10_Day5.png}
\caption{The average difference in LW downward at the surface and upward at TOA on day 5, from left to right. (preliminary figure)}
\label{fig:lwup_down_r3Day5}
\end{figure}
The area with lack of change in LW up or down is approximately the same area as where there is a negative change in LH and SH upward from the surface over the sea ice, see figure~\ref{fig:lhhfx_r3Day5}. Since there has been no change in LW there is no loss of warming from a decrease in LW reaching the surface, but the change can possibly be explained by looking at the SW radiation. The downward SW at the surface has been significantly decreased as a consequence of the increase in aerosol number concentration, see figure~\ref{fig:swup_down_r3Day5}. The SW radiation has been reflected by the smaller and more numerous droplets. This is known as the Twomey effect, and was described in Chapter~\ref{chap:theory}.

\caption{The average difference in skin temperature (the temperature of the surface), for day 5.}
\label{fig:skintemp_r3Day5}
\end{figure}
The albedo of sea ice is typically 0.5-0.7 which means that a fraction of the incident SW radiation is absorbed. Since the amount of incident SW radiation at the surface has been reduced by the cloud cover, the absorbed radiation is less than for a higher incident amount. The ice therefore has a lower temperature to give off SH with. 

%Look at temperature changes at the surface. Over ice and ocean.. 
The skin temperature, figure~\ref{fig:skintemp_r3Day5}, for the domain shows a small decrease in the same area as where there is less sensible and latent heat release.

Also the dynamics over ice and the ocean are different, so this could have an effect. The cold air over the ice may be intensified, while the sea surface temperature (SST) is the same for all the runs and there is no coupling with the ocean. There will therefore be no changes in the SSTs that could have an effect on the dynamics over the ocean. So the response may be smaller there...?
