abstract = {To provide a background for ARM's activities at the North Slope of Alaska/Adjacent Arctic Ocean sites, an overview is given of our current state of knowledge of Arctic cloud and radiation properties and processes. The authors describe the Arctic temperature and humidity characteristics, cloud properties and processes, radiative characteristics of the atmosphere and surface, direct and indirect radiative effects of aerosols, and the modeling and satellite remote sensing of cloud and radiative characteristics. An assessment is given of the current performance of satellite remote sensing and climate modeling in the Arctic as related to cloud and radiation issues. Radiation-climate feedback processes are discussed, and estimates are made of the sign and magnitude of the individual feedback components. Future plans to address these issues are described.},
