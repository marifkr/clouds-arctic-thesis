\chapter*{Abstract}
The influence of diminishing sea ice and increased aerosol number concentration on low clouds over the Beaufort Sea, north of Canada and Alaska, has been investigated by use of the Advanced Research Weather, Research and Forecasting (ARW) model.

The model was run for the five first days of September 2012, of which the discussion focuses on days 1 and 5. There the first day is most like and off line run, representing near instantaneous changes in clouds due to ice removal and aerosol number concentration increase, whereas by the last day the atmosphere has had time to adapt to the changes that were implemented at the start of the first day.

The results show that the removal of sea ice decreases both up and downwelling fluxes of shortwave (SW) radiation, for the first day, by 2.8 and 2.3~$\text{W/m}^2$ respectively. 

Here I also want to mention key findings in the thesis, and how my results compare to others. I would also like to end the abstract with a conclusion.
