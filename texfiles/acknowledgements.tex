\section*{Acknowledgements}

First of all I want to thank my main supervisor Jón Egill Kristjánsson for an interesting project and for the opportunity to come and work at NCAR for a couple of weeks. I also want to thank my other supervisor Kari Alterskjær for her "poking" and setting deadlines and pushing me for the past six months. I greatly appreciate their guidance and criticism throughout this project, and the doors that were always safe to knock on. 

Thank you so much to Anne Claire Fuillioux for helping me with setting up and getting started with WRF, and to both her and Kjell Andresen for help with technical problems during my work with this thesis. Thanks should also be given to Kjetil Schanke Aas for always taking time to answer any stupid WRF-related questions I might have had.

Thanks also to Gregory Thompson whom Jón Egill and I met with in Boulder, for meeting with us and answering all my e-mails about running the new aerosol-aware microphysics scheme in WRF.

These past two years have been very enjoyable in all their stress thanks to Marta and Helle especially, for all their positiveness.

Last, but not least, I would like to thank Henrik Andersen Sveinsson, for great technical help and moral support. @++
